Why Noir
===

The name is inspired by noir movie genre [Film noir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_noir).

It means "dark" in French and reminds me about [Pinot Noir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinot_noir) - red wine grape variety.

Why Blade
===
Not sure but often Film Noir is related to the movie ["Blade Runner"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner) and I think it was quite 
intuitive to combine the genre with the movie name.

What to expect here
===
In this blog I will post some useful tutorials or "howtos" on topics related to software development, 
DevOps and system administration.

I will start with some basic thinks about BigData processing and will see how it goes. 
I will use this blog as a reference for myself about setting and executing things on BigData or
whatever it comes.
